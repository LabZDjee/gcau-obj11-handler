## Purpose

This [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) project is based on [@labzDjee/agc-util](https://github.com/LabZDjee/agc-util) library to manipulate objects at level 11 of this type of configuration file. This is professional not confidential project. So its purpose and interest will not be further explained here

## Development Resources

To ease implementation of repetitive user interface elements, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) has been used to take full advantage of its `components` and `v-for` loops

Mix of *Vue.js* and *Electron* has been made with [Vue CLI Plugin Electron Builder](https://github.com/nklayman/vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder) (meaning *Vue* project was scaffolded with [Vue-CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org) 3/4). All stuff pertaining to main process, including `background.js` generated by the plugin, are moved to `./src/electron-main` folder (corrections made in `vue.config.js`)

Consistent management of internal data has been facilitated by [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org)

HTML structure and form controls are based on [Bulma](https://bulma.io) CSS framework, integrated in *Vue* with [Buefy](https://buefy.org). In retrospect, we'd preferred [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) over *Bulma*: *Bulma* form controls seem more limited and we couldn't really understand its layout concepts. On the plus side, *Bulma* variables helped in having a consistent design. Anyway, not much time was invested in tuning the UI aspect. Icons used come from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

After two decades, being responsive on a DOM element resize is still problematic (though [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) now exists, to be honest). [vue-resize](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-resize) is recommended to address this need
